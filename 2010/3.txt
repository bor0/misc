Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a game played on a rectangular board with NxN cells.
Some of the cells contain mines, and the rest of them are without.
The objective of the game is to clear the minefield without detonating a mine.

In this problem, you will be given the positions of the mines. Your task is to mark every cell 
on the minefield with a number from 0 to 8, depending on the number of neighboring cells with mines.
Every cell has 8 neighboring cells: 2 horizontally, 2 vertically and 4 diagonally.
The mines in the output will stay the same, i.e. 'x'. 

The minefield will be represented as String, with 'x' on a cell that has mine in it, and '.' on 
a cell without a mine. The first N characters of the String are the topmost row of the minefied,
the second N characters are the second row of the minefield, and so on.
 
Example: This is a 3x3 minefiled, with mines in the corner cells.

"x.x...x.x"
or
x.x
...
x.x

The output should be:

"x2x242x2x"
or
x2x
242
x2x

Input parameters:
  minefield - String, description of the minefield.
  N - integer, the size of the minefield.
  
Constraints:
  minefield will contain exactly N*N characters.
  each character of minefield will be either 'x' or '.'.
  N will be between 2 and 10 inclusive.
  
Return value:
 String, the minefield where each cell is marked with number from 0 to 8, or 'x'.
