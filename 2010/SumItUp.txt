SumItUp

For a given positive number N, calculate the sum of its digits.
If the sum is less then 10, return that value. If not, (i.e. the sum is greater or equal to 10) 
repeat the previous step until you have a number with only one digit.

Example:
N = 1598
- first iteration (1598): 1+ 5 + 8 + 9 = 23
- second iteration (23): 2 + 3 = 5
So, if N is 1598, the function should return 5.  

Input parameters:
  N - integer, the starting number
  
Constraints:
  N will be between 1 and 10000, inclusive. 
  
Return value:
 int, the sum that contains only one digit.
