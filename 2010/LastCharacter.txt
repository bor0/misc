LastCharacter

A long string is composed by concatenating N times the string "s".
From the resulting String all the characters at odd positions are removed.
Then from the string that remains, again all the characters at odd positions are removed.
The process continues until there is only one character left.

Your task is to find this last character.

Example: The string "LASTONE" is written 2 times
----------------------------- L A S T O N E L A S T O N E - A - T - N - L - S - O - E ----------------------------- A T N L S O E - T - L - O - --------------- T L O - L - ------- L

And the last character is L.

Input parameters:
  s - String, the string that will be concatenated to itself to form the resulting string. 
  N - integer, a number denoting how many times the string s is concatenated.

Constraints:
  Each character of s will be capital English letter, 'A' through 'Z'.
  The length of the string s will be between 2 and 100 inclusive.  
  N will be between 2 and 1000000 (one million) inclusive.

Return value:
 String, of length 1, which contains only the last remaining character.
