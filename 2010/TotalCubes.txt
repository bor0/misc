TotalCubes

Find how many total cubes are there in the range from A to B, inclusive.

An integer Y is total cube if it can be expressed as: Y = X*X*X, where X is also integer.
The first total cubes are: 1, 8, 27, 64 ...

Input parameters:
  A, B - integer, the lower and the upper bounds.  

Constraints:
  A, B will have between 1 and 1000000 inclusive.
  A will be less or equal to B (A<=B)
  
Return value:
 int, the number of total cubes in the given range.
