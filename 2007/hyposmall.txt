Is the hypotenuse smaller than the sum of the other 2 sides?

We will start with Pythagorean.

c^2 = a^2 + b^2 => c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)

I will mark the equations -

1) Meaning that the hypotenuse is larger than the sum of the other 2 sides;
2) Meaning that the hypotenuse is smaller than the sum of the other 2 sides.

c > a + b (1)
OR
c < a + b (2)

c^2 > a^2 + 2ab + b^2 (1)
OR
c^2 < a^2 + 2ab + b^2 (2)

a^2 + b^2 > a^2 + 2ab + b^2 (1)
OR
a^2 + b^2 < a^2 + 2ab + b^2 (2)

0 > 2ab (1)
OR
0 < 2ab (2)

For every a,b>0 it follows that the correct expression is 0 < 2ab or (2).

Which follows that the hypotenuse is smaller than the sum of the other 2 sides.
