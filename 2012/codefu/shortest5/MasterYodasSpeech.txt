"To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not" - Yoda to Obi-Wan Kenobi, Star Wars Episode III

Even though Master Yoda is a brilliant Jedi Master, his communication skills still need some work. Your 
Jedi Knight colleagues have heard that you have received training in the ancient art of computer 
programming and are now asking you for help. You will need to create a program that will take Master 
Yoda’s speech and transform it to human-readable form. Namely, your program needs to split Master Yoda’s 
sentence into parts delimited by comma characters and then construct a new sentence where the parts are in 
inverted order. The new sentence should not contain any commas, its first letter should be capitalized and 
all other letters should be lowercase. The new sentence should also not contain any whitespace characters 
before the first word or after the last word, nor multiple consecutive whitespace characters.

For example, this program would transform the quote above into “You are not strong enough to fight this 
lord sidious”

Note that “You are not” and “strong enough” belonged to different parts of Master Yoda’s sentence, therefore 
they are separated by a single empty space in the result. 


Input parameters:
  sentence – a string containing the sentence spoken by Master Yoda
  
Constraints:
  sentence will be no more than 1000 characters long.
  Each character in sentence will be a comma, a empty space or lowercase (‘a’ - ‘z’) or uppercase letter (‘A’ - ‘Z’).
  sentence will not contain consecutive empty spaces.
  After every comma character, there will be no empty space characters.
  Any two words will be separated either by a single empty space, or a comma and a single empty space.
  At least one uppercase or lowercase letter will be present between any two comma characters.
  The first and last characters in sentence will not be empty spaces or commas.

Return value:
  string - The human-readable version of Master Yoda’s sentence, containing no commas and with only the first letter capitalized.
