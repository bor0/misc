Greedy Gift Givers
A group of NP (2 . NP . 10) uniquely named friends has decided to exchange gifts of money. Each of these friends might 
or might not give some money to any or all of the other friends. Likewise, each friend might or might not receive money 
from any or all of the other friends. Your goal in this problem is to deduce how much more money each person gives than 
they receive. 

The rules for gift-giving are potentially different than you might expect. Each person sets aside a certain amount of 
money to give and divides this money evenly among all those to whom he or she is giving a gift. No fractional money is 
available, so dividing 3 among 2 friends would be 1 each for the friends with 1 left over -- that 1 left over stays in 
the giver's "account". 

In any group of friends, some people are more giving than others (or at least may have more acquaintances) and some 
people have more money than others. 

Given a group of friends, no one of whom has a name longer than 14 characters, the money each person in the group spends 
on gifts, and a (sub)list of friends to whom each person gives gifts, determine how much more (or less) each person in 
the group gives than they receive. 

IMPORTANT NOTE
The grader machine is a Linux machine that uses standard Unix conventions: end of line is a single character often known 
as '\n'. This differs from Windows, which ends lines with two charcters, '\n' and '\r'. Do not let your program get 
trapped by this! 

PROGRAM NAME: gift1
INPUT FORMAT
Line 1:  The single integer, NP  
Lines 2..NP+1:  Each line contains the name of a group member 
Lines NP+2..end:  NP groups of lines organized like this: The first line in the group tells the person's name who will 
be giving gifts.  
The second line in the group contains two numbers: The initial amount of money (in the range 0..2000) to be divided up 
into gifts by the giver and then the number of people to whom the giver will give gifts, NGi (0 . NGi . NP-1).  
If NGi is nonzero, each of the next NGi lines lists the the name of a recipient of a gift.

OUTPUT FORMAT
The output is NP lines, each with the name of a person followed by a single blank followed by the net gain or loss 
(final_money_value - initial_money_value) for that person. The names should be printed in the same order they appear on 
line 2 of the input. 

All gifts are integers. Each person gives the same integer amount of money to each friend to whom any money is given, 
and gives as much as possible that meets this constraint. Any money not given is kept by the giver.
