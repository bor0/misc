Directory Navigation


You are starting with a '/' and you can only change a directory 
relative to the one you are at the moment.

e.g. valid commands
  cd ..    (change one directory back)
  cd abc  (change toa subdirectory abc)

e.g. not valid commands
  cd / is not a valid command
  cd /dir is also a not valid command, you can't change back to the root, you need to navigate back with cd .. 
  cd a/b/c is also not a valid command, you can't change into more than one directory at once.

Given a set of directories, find the minimal number of "cd" commands to pass through all the directories.

e.g. 
  Directories /a , /b , /c, 
  Commands "cd a", "cd ..", "cd b", "cd ..", "cd c" go through all the directories
  The result is 5.

e.g. 
  Directories /a/b , /b , /a/c, 
  Commands "cd b", "cd ..", "cd a", "cd b", "cd..", "cd c" go through all the directories
  The result is 6.

Input parameters:
  directories - set of directories
  
Constraints:
  directories will contain between 1 and 50 elements inclusive
  each element of directories will be a string between 2 and 300 characters inclusive

  there will be no two '/' in the directory, and directory does not end with '/' 
  there will be no two same directories in the directories list
  each number will be between 0 and 1000000 (one million)

Return value:
  The minimum number of "cd" commands to pass through all the directories
