LizardsDream

One night Guki had a dream. It was one of those dreams,you just don't want to wake up from.
He dreamt, he was in heaven and, there, waiting for him were N lizard chicks(female lizards :D)
standing in a line. Just as he thought of running to them and taking them all home, the lizard
god appeared. The god said: "You can only take exactly M females where the leftmost and
rightmost female from the ones you pick may not be more than K units appart in the line.
Also the sum of their beauties must be greater than or equal to S." Guki wants to know in 
how many ways can he do that, but he got confused and summoned you in his dream, to help him.
So help him :). You are given int[] beauty, M, K and S. Calculate the number of ways in which 
you can pick females while satisfying the given conditions.
 
Input parameters:
  beauty - array of integers, the beauties of each of the N females
  M - integer, the exact number of females he must pick
  K - integer, the maximum distance between the leftmost and rightmost female you pick
  S - integer, the least sum of beauties of females you pick

e.g.
beauty={1,2,3,1}, M=2, K=2, S=4
This means: we have 4 females with beauties 1,2,3,1. We need to count the number of ways
to select 2 of them, whose sum of beauties will be greater than or equan to 4 and the distance 
between the leftmost and rightmost one we select will not be more than 2 units. For example the 
ones with index 0 and 1 are 1 unit apart (since 1-0=1). Female with index 1 and 3 are 2 units 
apart(3-1=2). So in this example we can select the pairs of females (0,2),(1,2),(2,3) since their 
sums of beauties are greater than or equal to 4. So the result is 3 (3 different ways to select 
the females).

Constraints:
  beauty will contain N elements where N is between 5 and 50 elements inclusive
  each element of beauty will be between 1 and 100 inclusive
  K will be between 1 and 15 inclusive
  M will be between 2 and K + 1 inclusive
  S will be between 1 and 5000 inclusive
  K will be less than N
  
Return value:
 int, the number of different ways to pick the females.
