HexPalindroms

Palindrome is a string which is symmetrical when read from both start and end.
Given a range of numbers, return the count of them which are palindromes when written in hexadecimal form.

For example, range [2580, 2590] has one palindrome hexadecimal number 2586 or hex "a1a". 

Input parameters:
  start - start of the range (inclusive)
  end - end of the range (inclusive)
  
Constraints:
  start is between 1 and 100000 inclusive
  end is between 1 and 100000 inclusive
  end is equal or greater than start

Return value:
  int - The count of palindrome hexadecimal numbers from the given range
