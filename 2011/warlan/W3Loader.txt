Warcraft III Memory Protection Remover by BoR0
----------------------------------------------

This loader has been tested and works FULLY with 1.19.

Place the file W3Loader.exe in your Warcraft III directory.
(usually "C:\Program Files\Warcraft III")

@@: If you have "Frozen Throne" installed, just run W3Loader.exe.

@@: If you have "Reign of Chaos" installed, just run W3Loader.exe

@@: If you have "Frozen Throne" installed, but would like to use it for
"Reign of Chaos" just run W3Roc.bat (this needs W3Loader.exe).



This loader removes the SetSecurityInfo() memory protection that
has been added recently to Warcraft III (1.18).

I'd like to thank:

ZoiD - for his deadlisting
[Wizzer] - for his API help
Silvernoma - for spreading the loader and keeping the greatest community
SecureGamers.com alive :)
