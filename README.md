Tutorials
=========
In this repository you will find a lot of stuff which I've been practicing throughout the years. I have a bunch of other stuff on my other computers, so as soon as I sort them I will be posting them here.

In addition to the practices, here are my favorite readings that shaped my knowledge in a way:

In addition, here are some good tutorials:

| 1. Win32asm tutorial    | http://www.madwizard.org/download/tutors/win32asmtutorial.zip |
| 2. DBMS Lecture Notes   | http://www.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/354/zaiane/material/notes/contents.html |
| 3. Lambda calculus      | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda__calculus |
| 4. Prolog               | https://staff.science.uva.nl/u.endriss/teaching/prolog/prolog.pdf |

Notes on the readings (books):

1. This is a classic. I believe any programmer should at least be aware of the things C offers, like manual memory management, working with stacks, etc. This is found to be useful even when programming in higher level languages. For example, whenever you create an anonymous function in JS, given its scope change we can see it as the stack frame change.
2. This book really helped me grasp recursion, and Scheme.
3. Even if you don't program in Haskell after reading this, it introduces you to a lot of good concepts (which some can be applied to other programming languages as well). Pattern matching, Algebraic data types, Monads/Monoids, Map/Reduce and their implementation, Currying, etc.
4. Introduces the reader to set theory, and proving properties for it. Found to be useful to prove correctness of functional programming languages programs. For example, using induction to prove the correctness of `length`.
5. Introduces the reader to common programming patterns, such as DRY, keeping up to date with tools, etc.
6. **Work in progress**.
7. Assumes at least some JavaScript experience. Introduces the reader to some useful JavaScript patterns. Also, JavaScript is used a lot these days, so it's preferable we keep up to date :)
8. **Work in progress**.

Notes on the readings (tutorials):

1. I read this tutorial a long time ago. It helped me understand 32-bit assembly in Windows.
2. The theory behind DB systems. Relational algebra, etc.
3. An interesting way to declare integers (and other objects) in terms of f(x), f(f(x)), etc.
4. Prolog was fun for me because it's a different non-mainstream paradigm and also introduces some interesting concepts.
