[16:40:55] <Depressed> why is A2.(*c).d wrong?
[16:41:03] <li_bai> if you are receiving a chunked encoded packet, how do you receive all of the packet without ever receiving 0 (making the server close the connection)
[16:41:41] <Zhivago> depressed: The syntax is wrong.
[16:42:01] <Depressed> is there a way to access the variable without using '->'
[16:42:06] <tp76> Depressed: you want to refer to c first then dereference.
[16:42:12] <Zao> li_bai: Last time I checked, C didn't have receiving functionality.

[16:42:22] <Zhivago> depressed: c is a label, A2.c is an object.
[16:42:22] <tp76> As in (A2.c) and you fill in the rest.
[16:42:48] <tp76> Anyway, why do you not want to use ->?
[16:42:51] <Zhivago> depressed: What is the type of A2.c?
[16:42:57] * rajbir (n=feynman@122.167.78.84) has joined ##c
[16:43:00] <Depressed> a pointer to a struct
[16:43:08] <li_bai> Zao: however you want to call recv()
[16:43:13] <Zhivago> depressed: So, derereference A2.c
[16:44:26] <Depressed> I see, thanks!  it isn't that I don't want to use ->, I just want to know its equivalent
[16:44:35] <Zhivago> Good.

[16:46:39] <tp76> Depressed: the equivalent of s->m is (*s).m

[16:47:52] <Depressed> (*A2.c).(*A1.d).b is also valid if I had a pointer to another struct in A1?
[16:48:32] <Zhivago> depressed: No. (*A1.d) is not a member name.

[16:49:13] <Depressed> what would I have to do in this case?
[16:49:38] <Zhivago> Depressed: Think about which object is the pointer that you want to dereference ...
[16:50:03] <Depressed> d is a pointer
[16:50:12] <Zhivago> No.
[16:50:17] <Zhivago> d is a syntax error.
[16:50:20] <Zhivago> Think harder.
[16:50:33] <Zhivago> How do you get to the member named d?

[16:50:50] <Depressed> (*(*A2.c).d).b ?
[16:51:01] <pozic> How do I print a wide string? I use wprintf(L"%s",something_of_type_wchar_t *), but it doesn't work.
[16:51:17] <Zhivago> depressed: That looks more plausible.
[16:51:23] <Depressed> great :)
