[19:14] <Y0UrShAD0W> What is LNTS?
[19:15] <PiAway> anyway...good to see you, i am off.
[19:15] <@SJrX> Long time no see
[19:15] <Y0UrShAD0W> I appreciate this. 
[19:16] <Y0UrShAD0W> From your side I am sure that you speak sincerely.

[19:37] <@bor0> does this hold a name or any kind of special meaning in mathematics? "number 999, the sum of digits is 9+9+9 = 27, 
  until we get one-digit only number 27 can be too divided in 2+7 = 9.. do the same for number 998 and you get 8, number(997) = 7, 
  etc. the pattern 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 is repeated for any number sequence"
[19:38] <Y0UrShAD0W> it means nothing
[19:39] <@SJrX> you mean the pattern works for 990 to 999?
[19:39] <@bor0> for 1...inf
[19:39] <@SJrX> I suspect that simply because you are subtracting 1
[19:40] <@SJrX> or adding 1
[19:40] <@bor0> I wrote a program in C to calculate this
[19:40] <@bor0> for numbers 0...999999 the pattern is the same
[19:40] <Y0UrShAD0W> it isn`t significant
[19:40] <Y0UrShAD0W> :)
[19:41] <@bor0> also the graph looks interesting... like //////////
[19:41] <@SJrX> Yeah
[19:41] <@SJrX> So the zeros are sporradic
[19:41] <@bor0> nothing is insignificant in mathematics, Y0UrShAD0W
[19:41] <@bor0> except you
[19:42] <Y0UrShAD0W> maybe
[19:46] <@bor0> hmm
[19:46] <@bor0> for -9999 ... 0 the pattern is -9, -8, -7, ..., -1
[19:47] <@bor0>      |
[19:47] <@bor0>      |/////
[19:47] <@bor0> -----------
[19:47] <@bor0> /////|0
[19:47] <@bor0>      |
[19:52] <Y0UrShAD0W> they look like some rockets

[20:43] <kmh_> you information bit
[20:44] <kmh_> funny information bit
[20:46] * kame (~Snail@MarsTurtle.users.undernet.org) has joined #math
[20:46] <kmh_> the current german chancellor was a former IMO participant

[21:21] <@SJrX> IMO?
[21:21] <@bor0> I got an answer from efnet
[21:21] <@SJrX> On what?
[21:21] <@bor0> the optimized way of doing that is f(x) = x%9
[21:21] <@SJrX> Oh
[21:21] <@SJrX> Yeah
[21:21] <@bor0> or mod(x,9)
[21:21] <@SJrX> that's what I figured
[21:21] <@bor0> still interesting
[21:22] <@SJrX> except I don't think that works
[21:22] <@bor0> what doesn't?
[21:22] <@SJrX> 9 % 9 = 0
[21:22] <@SJrX> but number(9) = 9
[21:22] <@bor0> hmm, right
[21:22] <@SJrX> It's similar
[21:22] <@bor0> yeah
[21:22] <@SJrX> But that's not exactly the same
[21:23] <@SJrX> number(10) = 1 
[21:23] <@bor0> only a number that the last digit is 9 is problematic
[21:24] <@SJrX> um :P
[21:24] <@SJrX> that's about 10% of them :)
[21:25] <@bor0> ;)
[21:25] <@bor0> 10% / inf = 0% ;)
[21:30] * Y0UrShAD0W (~aaa@5-244-207-85.vychcechy.adsl-llu.static.bluetone.cz) Quit (Ping timeout)
[21:31] <@bor0> that's wrong, should be multiplication.. so inf/10
[21:38] <@SJrX> Um
[21:38] <@SJrX> % are calculated differently the fact is that if you choose an arbitrary number there is a 10% chance that you will 
  guess a number that doesn't work
[21:41] <@SJrX> Undernet: 1, Efnet: 0
[21:42] <@SJrX> It's related to congruences however, I don't remember the specifics
[21:42] <@SJrX> it's very much related to the trick of adding up and seeing if a number is divisible by 3

[22:06] <@bor0> hi Karlo
[22:06] <spincat> what are the best math help channels on irc? (among all networks)
[22:06] <Y0UrShAD0W_> this one
[22:06] * ku-out is now known as kuuyku
[22:07] <@bor0> Karlo_, any comments on http://pastebin.com/m5265d00c ?
[22:08] <@Karlo_> It's known as "Casting out nines"
[22:09] <@bor0> wow
[22:09] <@bor0> how neat
[22:09] <@bor0> I knew there was something about it
[22:09] <@Karlo_> It's invariant under addition, subtraction, and multiplication,
[22:10] <@Karlo_> so it can be used as a quick check against arithmetic mistakes.
[22:10] <@bor0> haha
[22:10] <@bor0> the story about me coming to this is interesting
[22:10] <@bor0> without even knowing anything about it
[22:10] <@Karlo_> 675036 + 633327 = 1308363
[22:11] <@Karlo_> 6+7+5+0+3+6 = ... = 9, 6+3+3+3+2+7 = ... = 6, 1+3+0+8+3+6+3 = ... = 6
[22:12] <@bor0> yeah
[22:12] <@Karlo_> So we expect 9 + 6 = 6 to be true after casting out nines, which it is.
[22:12] <@Karlo_> How did you come across it?
[22:12] <@bor0> it's a long story, but I could explain
[22:13] <spincat> alright, well i told this hot gal from the UK to come on here and ask for help so try not to scare her off

[22:13] * zigggggy (ffssd@ool-4351c0d8.dyn.optonline.net) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:13] <@bor0> there is something going on in my head the last few months.. I ask myself a question, see a number, check if it's even 
  or odd,  and if it's odd then the answer is yes, otherwise no. by doing thuis repeatedly I came to this sum
[22:13] <@bor0> to this idea*

[22:14] * Ejrik123 (~l33tnes@147.84-48-200.nextgentel.com) has left #math
[22:14] <@bor0> I guess the line between wisdom and madness is thick
[22:15] <Y0UrShAD0W_> break through
[22:16] <Y0UrShAD0W_> I take note on my paper
[22:16] <@Karlo_> A related arithmetic check is to alternate the signs.
[22:16] <Y0UrShAD0W_> Does any have a pen ?
[22:16] <@bor0> how, Karlo_?
[22:16] <@Karlo_> 61583 -> +3-8+5-1+6 = 5
[22:17] <exactly_> I had a similar thing going on. I found that if f(456)=f(4+5+6)=f(15)=6 then f(993419999)=3+4+1=8
[22:17] <@bor0> I see
[22:17] <@Karlo_> (I started at the low-order digit to make sure that one is +)
[22:17] <@Karlo_> That one is "Casting out 11s"
[22:18] <@bor0> what's the difference between those two?
[22:18] <@Karlo_> For checking arithmetic, each of them gives a false positive only about one time in ten, but the two of them 
  combined would give a false positive only about one time in a hundred.
[22:18] <exactly_> i think its exactly the same, if you were adressing my question t o me
[22:19] <exactly_> t o=to
[22:19] <@bor0> oh
[22:19] <@Karlo_> (And neither one will give a false negative.)
[22:19] <@bor0> I see
[22:19] <@bor0> so the error with both is 1%, and with one of them only is 10% 
[22:20] <@Karlo_> Right.
[22:23] <@bor0> for more information, the numbers that I look at were mostly car registration tables ;)
[22:23] <exactly_> I was checking if the sum of a number was 6, which I did not like if it was
[22:23] <@bor0> I also talked to some of my friends and they had this same randomizing thing in their head
[22:23] <@bor0> I guess it's popular ;)
[22:24] <@Karlo_> Heh
[22:25] <exactly_> I was producing this series of numbers 7,5(7+7=14=5),3(5+7=12=3) etc
[22:25] <exactly_> I thought i had the most amazing series of numbers there were
[22:25] <@Karlo_> Adding 7 each time, and reducing?
[22:25] <@bor0> something in my brain said, do a program that will calculate the sum of digits, and ask around internet. there has to 
  be something on it
[22:25] <@bor0> then I checked for numbers 0..99999 and noticed that neat pattern
[22:25] <exactly_> adding 7 and take the sum of the number
[22:26] <@Karlo_> It's periodic :-)
[22:26] <exactly_> yes
