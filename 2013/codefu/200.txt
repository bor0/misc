PlasticNumbers

You want to write a number out of plastic, and you have plastic sets of digits '0' to '9'.
Each set has 10 digits, each digit exactly once.

Given a number, you need to count the number of sets that have to be used to create the number.

e.g.
 Number 10, can be written with '1' and '0' both of which are from one set.
 Number 100, in order to write the two zeros, you need to use two sets. 

At one point, you noticed that numbers 6 and 9 are the same, so you can easily reuse 6 as 9 and vice versa.

e.g. 
 Number 166, can be written by using one set, with numbers '1', '6' and then '9' rotated by 180 degrees.

Input parameters:
  number - a number to be written with the plastic digits.
  
Constraints:
  number will be between 0 and 1000000000 (one billion).

Return:
  The count of plastic sets needed to write the number.
